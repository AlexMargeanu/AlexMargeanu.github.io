<div class="col-lg-4 games"><img src="assets/EU%20Banner.jpg" class="pic" alt="Game Pic"><p class="tXt">Europa Universalis 4 is the game I was looking for all my life. A strategy game, an economic, diplomatic, war simulation. It offers great single-player experience that requires time to get good at but requires no time to get into, to lose yourself to its great gameplay loops and to truly enjoy a game the way I used to when I was a kid where I wouldn’t know things and a big part of the enjoyment would be the exploration and learning process. My love for the game started when I launched it and tried to play as the nation where I was born, Moldova. I quickly ended up looking at the ledgers and information I was offered, said that it’s too much and thought that the best course of action would be to start expanding my country, obviously… I attacked the Ottoman Empire, they came into my country, slapped me around and went home as I ended up quitting the game and saying it was a shitty game and a waste of time. I stopped playing it for about a week but a thought never left my mind: “This game beat me and I can’t accept that” so I started it up again and played until I became good, I think, 3.5 thousand hours later.
I host casual weekly multiplayer games for it and would love to have new people join us that want to have a fun experience with PVE and PVP. The games happen always on Sundays at 5pm Eastern European Time (EET).

 <div class="col-lg-4 games"><img src="assets/MineCraft%20Banner" class="pic" alt="Game Pic"><p class="tXt">Minecraft for me was a game that let me spill out all my creativity and do so in a way I enjoyed. As a kid I was into drawing and sculpting and anything else artistic, yet the only time I truly felt free though was in a video game about square blocks you could place anywhere.<br> I liked playing with anything that would let me build worlds, I wasn’t really limited to using Lego pieces or anything like that, if I had to add a pillow to the mix to make a mountain, sorry mom or dad, you aren’t sleeping on that pillow anytime soon. For this exact reason I always wanted to have a place to create and not be limited by real life, Minecraft offers the flexibility we need and it helps me have a place to celebrate, reward and spend time with my community.<br> My favorite experience on our Minecraft server was the celebration of my made-up holiday, “Dixgiving” (no genitalia involved), where we gathered in a player’s base that was beautified hours earlier by a crew of builders and we ended up spending time together. If you ever want to join us. Join our discord and the information to join will be available there.

<div class="col-lg-4 games"><img src="assets/WoW%20Banner%20Fixed.PNG" class="pic" alt="Game Pic"><p class="tXt">World of Warcraft is a game that I grew with, and it grew with me too, through the great and worse expansions and adventures, which I guess sums up my life as well. This is a game I was introduced to by my brother. I saw him play a night elf warrior when I was younger and told him the game looks like trash and I would never play it because there’s better games out there. Sigh… If only someone would bother to tell little me that I would end up spending most my time in it after that day. It’s a great game with simple stories that are based in big part in real life folklore and cultures, be it the European or Asian architecture in so many places, the plebian farms of Elwynn or the green plains of Mulgore. I am looking forward to the next expansion and to the many awesome stories that we’re going to have out of it, be it getting destroyed in new PVP areas or wiping hundreds of times in raids and dungeons. My favorite experience in wow besides defeating the Lich King for the first time or making all the friends I did with it would have to be the first birthday party I organized in the guild, I gathered everyone on the stairs of the Temple in Darnassus (RIP) to say happy birthday to the birthday person and then the ones that wanted to stay a bit longer I invited to the “after party” in Stormwinds secluded areas where we celebrated till the morning where I somehow as a kid managed to organize a cooler party than the many that I have attended in real life (yes people don’t know how to party), if this doesn’t speak to the ability of the game to create memorable moments I don’t know what does.

<div class="col-lg-4 games"><img src="assets/Terraria%20Banner.jpg" class="pic" alt="Game Pic"><p class="tXt">Terraria is a personal favorite of mine that combines worlds like that of Minecraft and games like World of Warcraft which I am a big fan of. I started playing this probably like the other 2 games, with no knowledge of what to do, how to do it and why exactly I’m doing it, but god was it great, every step of it, every boss beaten and every death from falling into traps, dying to giant boulders falling on me and my friends. Now that I think of it, I died a lot in this game, worth it. We had many cool builds and builders join along the way and I wish one day to have a big community centered on this game too, with an RP world and many other small and large activities and events that we have planned. 

</p></div>
 <div class="col-lg-4 games"><img src="assets/Dead%20by%20Daylight%20Banner.jpg" class="pic" alt="Game Pic"><p class="tXt">Where does one even start with this... it's awesome, its a broken shithow, the developers try to make it fun as much as they can yet they fail miserably at so many things, the game represents the decade very well. I enjoyed almost every hour of this game because i decided to not be miserable and salty about losses or bugs but if you're a person that doesn't like people disconnecting from matches and ruining your game or salty people saying they made sweet love to your mom in their own language after they won or lost, maybe this isn't the game for you, though if you like to meet awesome people that you might become friends with, people that might make you enjoy life more, try this game 100%. What Dead by Daylight does right is short matches with many different people that lets you enjoy the game in many ways. The constant updates will keep you from ever being bored. All in all, you want to waste time feeling scared at first and eventually like you're competing in a game of death and survival, get this game, or don't, i aint yo dad, do watchu want.

</p></div>
<div class="col-lg-4 games"><img src="assets/key.jpg" class="pic" alt="Game Pic"><p class="tXt">At the end of the day it's a stream and I am a streamer. I enjoy hanging out with you guys and playing the latest most awesome games because that's what us gamers do. I like getting suggestions from my fan base and if it proves to be an awesome game we will sink a couple of hours in it on stream. But most importantly the fun starts when you, the viewer is there. I do it for the community and I cannot achieve that without my loyal fanbase. If you're curious, drop by one day, say hello, introduce yourself and let me welcome you to my Realm in person. Cya there!
